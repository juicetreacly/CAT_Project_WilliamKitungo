        <h1><u>About Me</u></h1>
        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p> My name is William Kitungo.From my young age,i exhibited an insatiable curiosity for technology and computers.
            My fascination with understanding how systems worked led me to tinker with electronic devices and computer software.
            At the age of 10, i started learning programming languages and exploring the realms of cybersecurity.
            My enthusiasm to technology only intensified as i pursued my education.I was fueled by a desire to make the digital realm
            safer, so i decided to pivot towards ethical hacking.
